### The Nugget Newspaper

Since May 2024 I have been a freelance correspondent for Sisters' local paper, *The Nugget*.

Before my teaching career, I worked in a few jobs that allowed me to write for the web. All of these articles (and one project!) live in various corners of the internet, linked below.

### Digital history / data viz

As a grad student I created a project applying various digital humanities tools and approaches to do a "distant reading" of slave narratives in UNC's "Documenting the American South" online library.

### Harvard Kennedy School

When I worked at the Kennedy School's Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation as a research assistant and writer for the Project on Municipal Innovation, I occasionally wrote for the Ash Center's own website and other outlets, like Governing.

I also contributed reporting and writing to a few chapters in [*The Responsive City*](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Responsive+City%3A+Engaging+Communities+Through+Data+Smart+Governance-p-9781118910900). And I designed the cover!

### Harvard Gazette

When I worked for Harvard's office of Public Affairs & Communications, I had the opportunity to write a few stories for the Harvard Gazette, mostly on the arts and culture beat.
