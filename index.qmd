Hello, I'm Matt McClellan. I'm a humanities teacher living in Central Oregon.

I currently teach middle school social studies. From 2016 through 2023 I taught high school English in the Bay Area. Outside of school, I enjoyed participating in the soccer program at San Quentin State Prison. Check out the [San Quentin News](https://sanquentinnews.com/crawford-helps-sq-futbol-program-grow/) and [listen to Ear Hustle](https://www.earhustlesq.com/episodes/2021/11/17/yard-of-dreams) to learn more about sports and life inside the prison.

Before my teaching career, I spent my whole life (except a one-year sojourn to Santa Barbara) in the Boston area. In a past life I worked in admin at Harvard and lived in glamorous Somerville, MA.
