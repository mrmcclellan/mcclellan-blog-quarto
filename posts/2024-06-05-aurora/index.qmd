In early May the aurora was visible here in Central Oregon, and I had some success seeing and shooting it from behind Sisters High School. These photos are straight-out-of-camera jpgs; I have tried processing some of the RAWs, but other than correcting for lens distortion and leveling the horizon, I haven't yet got results I'm happy with.

I only had one close call with the sprinklers, which you can see above. After sprinting to snatch my stuff, I setup my tripod behind home plate of the softball field. Even with the bright lights in the parking lot just behind me, I was stunned by how visible the aurora was - these photos make it appear much more saturated, but it was indeed clear to the naked eye.
