This is a post that will house notes on my experience learning to use Quarto.

**Resources I have found useful:**

-   [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/)
-   [Bea Milz: Creating a blog with Quarto](https://beamilz.com/posts/2022-06-05-creating-a-blog-with-quarto/en)
-   [Albert Rapp: The ultimate guide to starting a Quarto blog](https://albert-rapp.de/posts/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide)
-   [Silvia Canelón: Hello Quarto: Porting my Website from Hugo Apéro](https://silviacanelon.com/blog/2023-09-29-hello-quarto/)

Things I need to do next:

-   Edit about page
-   Link datadrivencv to github repository (to host both pdf and html versions of resume)
-   Redirect matthewmcclellan.com/resume to github/resume.html
-   Create quarto blog repo on github
    -   link project to repo
    -   commit all updates
    -   create netlify site
    -   point netlify at quarto repo
    -   redirect personal domain to netlify
    -   done???
-   Reformat /writing so text wraps around image
